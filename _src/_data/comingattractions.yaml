    Come join the Dreher Drama Department for HADESTOWN: Teen Edition.
    <br/><br/>HADESTOWN follows two intertwining love stories — that of young dreamers Orpheus and Eurydice, and that of King Hades and his wife Persephone — as it invites audiences on a hell-raising journey to the underworld and back. Performed by a vibrant ensemble of actors, dancers and singers, HADESTOWN delivers a deeply resonant and defiantly hopeful theatrical experience.
    <br/><br/>Performances will be in the Dreher Auditorium May 15-17 at 7pm and May 17 at 2pm.
    <br/><br/><strong>Content Warnings:</strong> Mild cursing, references to drugs and alcohol, death.
    <br/><br/>This performance will contain flashing lights.
